#Introduction
Summit is a Node.js web framework for achievers. The framework aims to provide out of the box functionality to make creating a Node.js application with CouchDB and Handlebars templating effortless, and the project is powered at its core by [Bogart](https://github.com/nrstott/bogart). The name continues in the vein of Bogart and [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) as the Summit is what members of the Rat Pack referred to their group as internally.
